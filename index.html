      <h2>The world's number 1 boxers</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="reason-for-site-text">As you probably already know in the world of boxing it's not always easy to follow what's going on when there are so many different fighters from around the world, various weight categories and so many belts to be won. So I decided to create a website with profiles of the current highest ranked boxers in each weight division from lightweight to heavyweight with their photos, fight records, nicknames and major belts won etc etc and organised it to give an easy to understand overview of the number 1 boxers in the world. At the bottom of this page is a summary table with the top fighters in each weight division including the main contenders and other belt holders. I have also included a section with footage and photos of grassroots boxing with junior and amateur boxers. Other websites that I've found are useful I've included in the Links section.</p>

      <!--Short description of the career story of each boxer-->
      <p class="profile-text">Kambosos made his professional boxing debut in May 2013, at the age of 19, when he faced Filipino fighter Jayson Mac Gura and was victorious via a second round technical knockout. In December 2016, he captured the WBA Oceania title by beating world number nine Brandon Ogilvie. He then went on to face Qamil Balla in May 2017, whom he defeated by unanimous decision in a ten-round fight. Five months later, he knocked out Krai Setthaphon in the ninth round and won the WBA Oceania and IBF Pan Pacific titles in the lightweight division. In June 2017, Kambosos was tabbed by Manny Pacquiao as his main sparring partner in preparation for the fight with Jeff Horn and was Pacquiao's main sparring partner for his fights after Horn as well. In April 2018, Kambosos signed a promotional contract with DiBella Entertainment. In May 2018, he made his debut in the US and knocked out Jose Forero in just 1 minute and 48 seconds. On 19 January 2019, Kambosos defeated Rey Perez at The MGM Grand in Las Vegas on the undercard of Manny Pacquiao vs Adrien Broner via unanimous decision in his second fight on US soil. On 7 June in Athens, Kambosos returned to his native land of Greece and knocked out Venezuelan 11–2 (9 KOs) Richard Pena in round six in front of the packed out Galatsi Olympic Hall. He called out former two division world champion José Pedraza after his victory. More recently he defeated Teófimo López on points who was the previous number 1 ranked in the lightweight division to become the new champion.</p>

He is the undisputed light-welterweight champion, having held the WBA (Super), IBF, and Ring magazine titles since 2019 and the WBC and WBO titles after defeating José Ramírez in May 2021. At regional level, he held the Commonwealth light-welterweight title from 2016 to 2017, and as an amateur, he won a silver medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and gold at the 2014 edition. He is one of only 6 men to be a unified four belt world champion.

        With his win over Ramírez, Taylor became the second Scotsman to be an undisputed champion and the first Brit to do so in the four-belt era. Nicknamed 'The Tartan Tornado' for his aggressive style, Taylor's knockout-to-win percentage stands at 72%. As of October 2021, he is ranked as the world's best active light-welterweight by BoxRec and the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB), as well as the fifth-best active boxer, pound-for-pound, by The Ring, and sixth by the TBRB and the Boxing Writers Association of America. He recently on 26th February had a controversial poits win over Jack Caterall who had knocked Taylor to the floor in the seventh round and when the final bell went many including Caterall himself was convinced that he had won but the scorecards of two of the three judges were in favour of a Taylor win. Subsequently the fights judges were investigated by British Boxing and one of the Judges that had scored Taylor winning actually got demoted due to his biased scoring of the fight compared to what most people saw as a Catterall win. Still it was decided that Taylor had won but many fans, the press and commentators alike disagreed.</p>

      <p  class="profile-text">Gennadiy Gennadyevich Golovkin; also spelled Gennady; often known by his nickname "GGG" or "Triple G", is a Kazakhstani professional boxer. He is a two-time middleweight world champion, having held the IBF and IBO titles since 2019. He previously held the unified WBA (Super), WBC, IBF and IBO titles between 2014 and 2018 and was ranked as the world's best boxer, pound for pound, from September 2017 to September 2018 by The Ring magazine. As of November 2021, he is ranked as the world's second-best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec, and ninth by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB). He is also ranked as the world's best active middleweight by BoxRec, The Ring, and TBRB, and second by ESPN.

        Golovkin won the WBA interim middleweight title in 2010 by defeating Milton Núñez. The WBA elevated him to Regular champion status in the same year. He won the IBO title the following year. In 2014, Golovkin was elevated to the status of WBA (Super) champion and successfully defended both his titles against Daniel Geale. Later that year he defeated Marco Antonio Rubio to win WBC interim middleweight title, and defeated David Lemieux for the IBF middleweight title in 2015. After Canelo Álvarez vacated his WBC middleweight title in 2016, Golovkin was elevated to full champion and held three of the four major world titles in boxing until being stripped by the IBF in 2018 for not fighting Sergiy Derevyanchenko. Golovkin lost all his titles, as well as his undefeated record, following a loss to Álvarez in 2018. He regained his IBF and IBO titles by defeating Derevyanchenko in 2019.

        A calculating pressure fighter, Golovkin is known for his exceptionally powerful and precise punching, balance, and methodical movement inside the ring. With a streak of 23 knockouts that spanned from 2008 to 2017, he holds the highest knockout-to-win ratio – 89.7% – in middleweight championship history. Golovkin is also said to have one of the most durable chins in boxing history, having never been knocked down or otherwise stopped in a total of 393 fights, 43 as a professional and 350 as an amateur.

        In his amateur career, Golovkin won a gold medal in the middleweight division at the 2003 World Championships. He went on to represent Kazakhstan at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning a middleweight silver medal.</p>

      <p class="profile-text">Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Usyk is a Ukrainian professional boxer. He is a world champion in two weight classes, having held the unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles since defeating Anthony Joshua in September 2021; and the undisputed cruiserweight title from 2018 to 2019, being the first cruiserweight champion to hold all four major world titles. With his victory over Joshua, Usyk became one of only three boxers to have unified the cruiserweight world titles and become a world heavyweight champion, joining Evander Holyfield and David Haye.

        As an amateur, Usyk won gold medals at the 2011 World Championships and 2012 Olympics, both in the heavyweight division. He turned professional in 2013 and won the undisputed cruiserweight championship in his 15th professional fight in 2018. Three of his titles were won during the inaugural World Boxing Super Series, in which he won the Muhammad Ali Trophy, as well as The Ring magazine and lineal cruiserweight titles. For his achievements, Usyk was named the 2018 Fighter of the Year by Sports Illustrated, ESPN, The Ring and the Boxing Writers Association of America.

        In 2018 Usyk became the fourth male boxer in history to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO titles, after Jermain Taylor, Bernard Hopkins and Terence Crawford. He was the first Ukrainian undisputed champion. He is particularly notable for the speed of his accomplishments, winning his first world title in his tenth fight, and becoming the undisputed champion of his weight class by his fifteenth fight. Usyk vacated his cruiserweight titles in 2019 to move up to heavyweight. By that point, in sixteen fights he had defeated five current or former world champions.

        As of October 2021, Usyk is ranked as the world's second-best active boxer, pound for pound, by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB) and The Ring, and fifth by BoxRec, as well as the world's second-best active heavyweight by BoxRec, ESPN and TBRB.</p>

      <p class="profile-text">Tyson Luke Fury is a British professional boxer. He is a two-time world heavyweight champion, having held the WBC and The Ring magazine titles since defeating Deontay Wilder in 2020; previously he held the unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO, and The Ring titles after defeating Wladimir Klitschko in 2015. With his defeat of Wilder, Fury became the third heavyweight, after Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali, to hold The Ring magazine title twice, and is widely considered by media outlets to be the lineal heavyweight champion. As of November 2021, Fury is ranked as the world's best active heavyweight by ESPN, the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB), and BoxRec, as well as the third-best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec, fourth by ESPN, and seventh by the TBRB and the Boxing Writers Association of America.

        As an amateur, Fury represented both England and Ireland, as he was born in Manchester, to an Irish Traveller family. Fury's family lineage comes from Belfast and Galway; his parents emigrated to England at a young age. He won the ABA super-heavyweight title in 2008 before turning professional later that year at 20 years of age. After winning the English heavyweight title twice, he became the British and Commonwealth champion in 2011 by defeating the 14–0 Derek Chisora. He then won the Irish and WBO Inter-Continental titles, before defeating Chisora again in a 2014 rematch for the European and WBO International heavyweight titles. This success, along with his 24–0 record, set up a match with the long-reigning world champion Wladimir Klitschko in Germany, which Fury won by unanimous decision.

        Fury was stripped of his IBF title 10 days after the Klitschko bout as he was unable to grant a fight with the IBF's mandatory challenger, Vyacheslav Glazkov, due to a rematch clause in his contract with Klitschko. The rematch did not materialise as Fury suffered from mental health issues leading to alcoholism, recreational drug use and extreme weight gain. He was charged with anti-doping violations. In 2016, he vacated the WBA, WBO, and IBO titles; The Ring stripped him of his last remaining title in early 2018. Later that year, after more than two years of inactivity, Fury challenged for the WBC heavyweight title against Wilder. The fight was controversially scored as a draw. Fury's strong performance against Wilder (including recovering from a heavy knockdown in the final round) earned him Comeback of the Year from The Ring and numerous other awards. In the rematch in February 2020, Fury defeated Wilder by a technical knockout in the seventh round after a dominant performance, and knocked out Wilder again in a third fight in October 2021, this time in the 11th round.</p>
